65	O75084	Receptor for Wnt proteins. Most frizzled receptors are coupled to the beta-catenin canonical signaling pathway, which leads to the activation of disheveled proteins, inhibition of GSK-3 kinase, nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and activation of Wnt target genes. A second signaling pathway involving PKC and calcium fluxes has been seen for some family members, but it is not yet clear if it represents a distinct pathway or if it can be integrated in the canonical pathway, as PKC seems to be required for Wnt-mediated inactivation of GSK-3 kinase. Both pathways seem to involve interactions with G-proteins. Activation by WNT8 induces expression of beta-catenin target genes (By similarity). Following ligand activation, binds to CCDC88C/DAPLE which displaces DVL1 from FZD7 and leads to inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling, activation of G-proteins by CCDC88C and triggering of non-canonical Wnt responses (PubMed:26126266).

The eIF-3 complex stimulates mRNA recruitment to the 43S PIC and scanning of the mRNA for AUG recognition. The eIF-3 complex is also required for disassembly and recycling of post-termination ribosomal complexes and subsequently prevents premature joining of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits prior to initiation (PubMed:17581632). The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation, including cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis, and uses different modes of RNA stem-loop binding to exert either translational activation or repression (PubMed:25849773)	Cytoplasm

However, upon hydrolysis of the ATP to ADP, it undergoes a conformational change that increases its affinity for substrate proteins. HSP70 goes through repeated cycles of ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange, which permits cycles of substrate binding and release. The HSP70-associated co-chaperones are of three types: J-domain co-chaperones HSP40s (stimulate ATPase hydrolysis by HSP70), the nucleotide exchange factors (NEF) such as BAG1/2/3 (facilitate conversion of HSP70 from the ADP-bound to the ATP-bound state thereby promoting substrate release), and the TPR domain chaperones such as HOPX and STUB1 (PubMed:24121476, PubMed:24318877, PubMed:26865365, PubMed:27474739). Plays a critical role in mitochondrial import, delivers preproteins to the mitochondrial import receptor TOMM70 (PubMed:12526792). Acts as a repressor of transcriptional activation. Inhibits the transcriptional coactivator activity of CITED1 on Smad-mediated transcription. Component of the PRP19-CDC5L complex that forms an integral part of the spliceosome and is required for activating pre-mRNA splicing. May have a scaffolding role in the spliceosome assembly as it contacts all other components of the core complex. Binds bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and mediates LPS-induced inflammatory response, including TNF secretion by monocytes (PubMed:10722728, PubMed:11276205). Substrate recognition component in chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective protein degradation process that mediates degradation of proteins with a -KFERQ motif: HSPA8/HSC70 specifically recognizes and binds cytosolic proteins bearing a -KFERQ motif and promotes their recruitment to the surface of the lysosome where they bind to lysosomal protein LAMP2 (PubMed:11559757, PubMed:2799391, PubMed:36586411). KFERQ motif-containing proteins are eventually transported into the lysosomal lumen where they are degraded (PubMed:11559757, PubMed:2799391, PubMed:36586411). In conjunction with LAMP2, facilitates MHC class II presentation of cytoplasmic antigens by guiding antigens to the lysosomal membrane for interaction with LAMP2 which then elicits MHC class II presentation of peptides to the cell membrane (PubMed:15894275). Participates in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) quality control pathway in conjunction with J domain-containing co-chaperones and the E3 ligase STUB1 (PubMed:23990462). It is recruited to clathrin-coated vesicles through its interaction with DNAJC6 leading to activation of HSPA8/HSC70 ATPase activity and therefore uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles (By similarity)	Cytoplasm
187	P27708	Multifunctional protein that encodes the first 3 enzymatic activities of the de novo pyrimidine pathway: carbamoylphosphate synthetase (CPSase; EC 6.3.5.5), aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase; EC 2.1.3.2) and dihydroorotase (DHOase; EC 3.5.2.3). The CPSase-function is accomplished in 2 steps, by a glutamine-dependent amidotransferase activity (GATase) that binds and cleaves glutamine to produce ammonia, followed by an ammonium-dependent carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, which reacts with the ammonia, hydrogencarbonate and ATP to form carbamoyl phosphate. The endogenously produced carbamoyl phosphate is sequestered and channeled to the ATCase active site. ATCase then catalyzes the formation of carbamoyl-L-aspartate from L-aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate. In the last step, DHOase catalyzes the cyclization of carbamoyl aspartate to dihydroorotate	Cytoplasm
188	P04637	Multifunctional transcription factor that induces cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis upon binding to its target DNA sequence (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:24652652, PubMed:35618207, PubMed:36634798, PubMed:38653238, PubMed:9840937). Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17189187, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:24652652, PubMed:38653238, PubMed:9840937). Negatively regulates cell division by controlling expression of a set of genes required for this process (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:24652652, PubMed:9840937). One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression (PubMed:12524540, PubMed:17189187). Its pro-apoptotic activity is activated via its interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 (PubMed:12524540). However, this activity is inhibited when the interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 is displaced by PPP1R13L/iASPP (PubMed:12524540). In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seems to have an effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis.

In the mature central nervous system (CNS), regulates neurotransmitter movements by phosphorylating substrates associated with neurotransmitter release and synapse plasticity; synaptic vesicle exocytosis, vesicles fusion with the presynaptic membrane, and endocytosis. Promotes cell survival by activating anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2 and STAT3, and negatively regulating of JNK3/MAPK10 activity. Phosphorylation of p53/TP53 in response to genotoxic and oxidative stresses enhances its stabilization by preventing ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation, and induces transactivation of p53/TP53 target genes, thus regulating apoptosis. Phosphorylation of p35/CDK5R1 enhances its stabilization by preventing calpain-mediated proteolysis producing p25/CDK5R1 and avoiding ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation. During aberrant cell-cycle activity and DNA damage, p25/CDK5 activity elicits cell-cycle activity and double-strand DNA breaks that precedes neuronal death by deregulating HDAC1. DNA damage triggered phosphorylation of huntingtin/HTT in nuclei of neurons protects neurons against polyglutamine expansion as well as DNA damage mediated toxicity. Phosphorylation of PXN reduces its interaction with PTK2/FAK1 in matrix-cell focal adhesions (MCFA) during oligodendrocytes (OLs) differentiation.

Core component of the UV-DDB complex (UV-damaged DNA-binding protein complex), a complex that recognizes UV-induced DNA damage and recruit proteins of the nucleotide excision repair pathway (the NER pathway) to initiate DNA repair (PubMed:15448697, PubMed:16260596, PubMed:16407242, PubMed:16940174).

Also functions as a component of numerous distinct DCX (DDB1-CUL4-X-box) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes which mediate the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (PubMed:14739464, PubMed:16407252, PubMed:16482215, PubMed:17079684, PubMed:18332868, PubMed:18381890, PubMed:19966799, PubMed:22118460, PubMed:25043012, PubMed:25108355, PubMed:28886238). The functional specificity of the DCX E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex is determined by the variable substrate recognition component recruited by DDB1 (PubMed:14739464, PubMed:16407252, PubMed:16482215, PubMed:17079684, PubMed:18332868, PubMed:18381890, PubMed:19966799, PubMed:22118460, PubMed:25043012, PubMed:25108355).

The ubiquitination of histones may facilitate their removal from the nucleosome and promote subsequent DNA repair (PubMed:16473935, PubMed:16678110, PubMed:17041588, PubMed:18593899). DCX(DDB2) also ubiquitinates XPC, which may enhance DNA-binding by XPC and promote NER (PubMed:15882621). DCX(DTL) plays a role in PCNA-dependent polyubiquitination of CDT1 and MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of TP53 in response to radiation-induced DNA damage and during DNA replication (PubMed:17041588).

211	Q92616	Ribosome collision sensor that plays a key role in the RNF14-RNF25 translation quality control pathway, a pathway that takes place when a ribosome has stalled during translation, and which promotes ubiquitination and degradation of translation factors on stalled ribosomes (PubMed:32610081, PubMed:36638793, PubMed:37651229, PubMed:37951215, PubMed:37951216). Directly binds to the ribosome and acts as a sentinel for colliding ribosomes: activated following ribosome stalling and promotes recruitment of RNF14, which directly ubiquitinates EEF1A1/eEF1A, leading to its degradation (PubMed:36638793, PubMed:37951215, PubMed:37951216). In addition to EEF1A1/eEF1A, the RNF14-RNF25 translation quality control pathway mediates degradation of ETF1/eRF1 and ubiquitination of ribosomal protein (PubMed:36638793, PubMed:37651229). GCN1 also acts as a positive activator of the integrated stress response (ISR) by mediating activation of EIF2AK4/GCN2 in response to amino acid starvation (By similarity). Interaction with EIF2AK4/GCN2 on translating ribosomes stimulates EIF2AK4/GCN2 kinase activity, leading to phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF-2-alpha/EIF2S1) (By similarity). EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation converts EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha into a global protein synthesis inhibitor, leading to a global attenuation of cap-dependent translation, and thus to a reduced overall utilization of amino acids, while concomitantly initiating the preferential translation of ISR-specific mRNAs, such as the transcriptional activator ATF4, and hence allowing ATF4-mediated reprogramming of amino acid biosynthetic gene expression to alleviate nutrient depletion (By similarity)	Cytoplasm
212	Q8NC51	Ribosome-binding protein that promotes ribosome hibernation, a process during which ribosomes are stabilized in an inactive state and preserved from proteasomal degradation (PubMed:36691768). Acts via its association with EEF2/eEF2 factor, sequestering EEF2/eEF2 at the A-site of the ribosome and promoting ribosome stabilization and storage in an inactive state (By similarity). May also play a role in the regulation of mRNA stability: binds to the 3'-most 134 nt of the SERPINE1/PAI1 mRNA, a region which confers cyclic nucleotide regulation of message decay (PubMed:11001948). Seems to play a role in PML-nuclear bodies formation (PubMed:28695742)	Cytoplasm
213	P55884	RNA-binding component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complex, which is required for several steps in the initiation of protein synthesis (PubMed:17581632, PubMed:25849773, PubMed:27462815, PubMed:9388245). The eIF-3 complex associates with the 40S ribosome and facilitates the recruitment of eIF-1, eIF-1A, eIF-2:GTP:methionyl-tRNAi and eIF-5 to form the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC). The eIF-3 complex stimulates mRNA recruitment to the 43S PIC and scanning of the mRNA for AUG recognition. The eIF-3 complex is also required for disassembly and recycling of post-termination ribosomal complexes and subsequently prevents premature joining of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits prior to initiation (PubMed:17581632, PubMed:9388245). The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation, including cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis, and uses different modes of RNA stem-loop binding to exert either translational activation or repression (PubMed:25849773)	Cytoplasm

215	Q92900	RNA-dependent helicase required for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of aberrant mRNAs containing premature stop codons and modulates the expression level of normal mRNAs (PubMed:11163187, PubMed:16086026, PubMed:18172165, PubMed:21145460, PubMed:21419344, PubMed:24726324). Is recruited to mRNAs upon translation termination and undergoes a cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation; its phosphorylation appears to be a key step in NMD (PubMed:11544179, PubMed:25220460). Recruited by release factors to stalled ribosomes together with the SMG1C protein kinase complex to form the transient SURF (SMG1-UPF1-eRF1-eRF3) complex (PubMed:19417104). In EJC-dependent NMD, the SURF complex associates with the exon junction complex (EJC) (located 50-55 or more nucleotides downstream from the termination codon) through UPF2 and allows the formation of an UPF1-UPF2-UPF3 surveillance complex which is believed to activate NMD (PubMed:21419344). Phosphorylated UPF1 is recognized by EST1B/SMG5, SMG6 and SMG7 which are thought to provide a link to the mRNA degradation machinery involving exonucleolytic and endonucleolytic pathways, and to serve as adapters to protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), thereby triggering UPF1 dephosphorylation and allowing the recycling of NMD factors (PubMed:12554878). UPF1 can also activate NMD without UPF2 or UPF3, and in the absence of the NMD-enhancing downstream EJC indicative for alternative NMD pathways (PubMed:18447585). Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation at the end of phase S; the function is independent of UPF2 (PubMed:16086026, PubMed:18172165). For the recognition of premature termination codons (PTC) and initiation of NMD a competitive interaction between UPF1 and PABPC1 with the ribosome-bound release factors is proposed (PubMed:18447585, PubMed:25220460). The ATPase activity of UPF1 is required for disassembly of mRNPs undergoing NMD (PubMed:21145460). Together with UPF2 and dependent on TDRD6, mediates the degradation of mRNA harboring long 3'UTR by inducing the NMD machinery (By similarity). Also capable of unwinding double-stranded DNA and translocating on single-stranded DNA (PubMed:30218034)	Cytoplasm
216	Q14671	Sequence-specific RNA-binding protein that acts as a post-transcriptional repressor by binding the 3'-UTR of mRNA targets. Binds to an RNA consensus sequence, the Pumilio Response Element (PRE), 5'-UGUANAUA-3', that is related to the Nanos Response Element (NRE) (PubMed:18328718, PubMed:21397187, PubMed:21572425, PubMed:21653694). Mediates post-transcriptional repression of transcripts via different mechanisms: acts via direct recruitment of the CCR4-POP2-NOT deadenylase leading to translational inhibition and mRNA degradation (PubMed:22955276). Also mediates deadenylation-independent repression by promoting accessibility of miRNAs (PubMed:18776931, PubMed:20818387, PubMed:20860814, PubMed:22345517). Following growth factor stimulation, phosphorylated and binds to the 3'-UTR of CDKN1B/p27 mRNA, inducing a local conformational change that exposes miRNA-binding sites, promoting association of miR-221 and miR-222, efficient suppression of CDKN1B/p27 expression, and rapid entry to the cell cycle (PubMed:20818387). Acts as a post-transcriptional repressor of E2F3 mRNAs by binding to its 3'-UTR and facilitating miRNA regulation (PubMed:22345517, PubMed:29474920). Represses a program of genes necessary to maintain genomic stability such as key mitotic, DNA repair and DNA replication factors. Its ability to repress those target mRNAs is regulated by the lncRNA NORAD (non-coding RNA activated by DNA damage) which, due to its high abundance and multitude of PUMILIO binding sites, is able to sequester a significant fraction of PUM1 and PUM2 in the cytoplasm (PubMed:26724866). Involved in neuronal functions by regulating ATXN1 mRNA levels: acts by binding to the 3'-UTR of ATXN1 transcripts, leading to their down-regulation independently of the miRNA machinery (PubMed:25768905, PubMed:29474920). Plays a role in cytoplasmic sensing of viral infection (PubMed:25340845). In testis, acts as a post-transcriptional regulator of spermatogenesis by binding to the 3'-UTR of mRNAs coding for regulators of p53/TP53. Involved in embryonic stem cell renewal by facilitating the exit from the ground state: acts by targeting mRNAs coding for naive pluripotency transcription factors and accelerates their down-regulation at the onset of differentiation (By similarity). Binds specifically to miRNA MIR199A precursor, with PUM2, regulates miRNA MIR199A expression at a postranscriptional level (PubMed:28431233)	Cytoplasm
217	P11802	Ser/Thr-kinase component of cyclin D-CDK4 (DC) complexes that phosphorylate and inhibit members of the retinoblastoma (RB) protein family including RB1 and regulate the cell-cycle during G(1)/S transition. Phosphorylation of RB1 allows dissociation of the transcription factor E2F from the RB/E2F complexes and the subsequent transcription of E2F target genes which are responsible for the progression through the G(1) phase. Hypophosphorylates RB1 in early G(1) phase. Cyclin D-CDK4 complexes are major integrators of various mitogenenic and antimitogenic signals. Also phosphorylates SMAD3 in a cell-cycle-dependent manner and represses its transcriptional activity.

218	O15111	Serine kinase that plays an essential role in the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway which is activated by multiple stimuli such as inflammatory cytokines, bacterial or viral products, DNA damages or other cellular stresses (PubMed:18626576, PubMed:9244310, PubMed:9252186, PubMed:9346484). Acts as a part of the canonical IKK complex in the conventional pathway of NF-kappa-B activation and phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B on serine residues (PubMed:18626576, PubMed:35952808, PubMed:9244310, PubMed:9252186, PubMed:9346484). These modifications allow polyubiquitination of the inhibitors and subsequent degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:18626576, PubMed:9244310, PubMed:9252186, PubMed:9346484). In turn, free NF-kappa-B is translocated into the nucleus and activates the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in immune response, growth control, or protection against apoptosis (PubMed:18626576, PubMed:9244310, PubMed:9252186, PubMed:9346484). Negatively regulates the pathway by phosphorylating the scaffold protein TAXBP1 and thus promoting the assembly of the A20/TNFAIP3 ubiquitin-editing complex (composed of A20/TNFAIP3, TAX1BP1, and the E3 ligases ITCH and RNF11) (PubMed:21765415). Therefore, CHUK plays a key role in the negative feedback of NF-kappa-B canonical signaling to limit inflammatory gene activation. As part of the non-canonical pathway of NF-kappa-B activation, the MAP3K14-activated CHUK/IKKA homodimer phosphorylates NFKB2/p100 associated with RelB, inducing its proteolytic processing to NFKB2/p52 and the formation of NF-kappa-B RelB-p52 complexes (PubMed:20501937). In turn, these complexes regulate genes encoding molecules involved in B-cell survival and lymphoid organogenesis. Also participates in the negative feedback of the non-canonical NF-kappa-B signaling pathway by phosphorylating and destabilizing MAP3K14/NIK. Within the nucleus, phosphorylates CREBBP and consequently increases both its transcriptional and histone acetyltransferase activities (PubMed:17434128). Modulates chromatin accessibility at NF-kappa-B-responsive promoters by phosphorylating histones H3 at 'Ser-10' that are subsequently acetylated at 'Lys-14' by CREBBP (PubMed:12789342). Additionally, phosphorylates the CREBBP-interacting protein NCOA3. Also phosphorylates FOXO3 and may regulate this pro-apoptotic transcription factor (PubMed:15084260). Phosphorylates RIPK1 at 'Ser-25' which represses its kinase activity and consequently prevents TNF-mediated RIPK1-dependent cell death (By similarity). Phosphorylates AMBRA1 following mitophagy induction, promoting AMBRA1 interaction with ATG8 family proteins and its mitophagic activity (PubMed:30217973)	Cytoplasm
219	O14920	Serine kinase that plays an essential role in the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway which is activated by multiple stimuli such as inflammatory cytokines, bacterial or viral products, DNA damages or other cellular stresses (PubMed:20434986, PubMed:20797629, PubMed:21138416, PubMed:30337470, PubMed:9346484). Acts as a part of the canonical IKK complex in the conventional pathway of NF-kappa-B activation (PubMed:9346484). Phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B on 2 critical serine residues (PubMed:20434986, PubMed:20797629, PubMed:21138416, PubMed:9346484). These modifications allow polyubiquitination of the inhibitors and subsequent degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:20434986, PubMed:20797629, PubMed:21138416, PubMed:9346484). In turn, free NF-kappa-B is translocated into the nucleus and activates the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in immune response, growth control, or protection against apoptosis (PubMed:20434986, PubMed:20797629, PubMed:21138416, PubMed:9346484). In addition to the NF-kappa-B inhibitors, phosphorylates several other components of the signaling pathway including NEMO/IKBKG, NF-kappa-B subunits RELA and NFKB1, as well as IKK-related kinases TBK1 and IKBKE (PubMed:11297557, PubMed:14673179, PubMed:20410276, PubMed:21138416). IKK-related kinase phosphorylations may prevent the overproduction of inflammatory mediators since they exert a negative regulation on canonical IKKs (PubMed:11297557, PubMed:20410276, PubMed:21138416). Phosphorylates FOXO3, mediating the TNF-dependent inactivation of this pro-apoptotic transcription factor (PubMed:15084260). Also phosphorylates other substrates including NAA10, NCOA3, BCL10 and IRS1 (PubMed:17213322, PubMed:19716809). Phosphorylates RIPK1 at 'Ser-25' which represses its kinase activity and consequently prevents TNF-mediated RIPK1-dependent cell death (By similarity). Phosphorylates the C-terminus of IRF5, stimulating IRF5 homodimerization and translocation into the nucleus (PubMed:25326418). Following bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TLR4 endocytosis, phosphorylates STAT1 at 'Thr-749' which restricts interferon signaling and anti-inflammatory responses and promotes innate inflammatory responses (PubMed:38621137). IKBKB-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 at 'Thr-749' promotes binding of STAT1 to the ARID5A promoter, resulting in transcriptional activation of ARID5A and subsequent ARID5A-mediated stabilization of IL6 (PubMed:32209697). It also promotes binding of STAT1 to the IL12B promoter and activation of IL12B transcription (PubMed:32209697)	Cytoplasm
220	P78362	Serine/arginine-rich protein-specific kinase which specifically phosphorylates its substrates at serine residues located in regions rich in arginine/serine dipeptides, known as RS domains and is involved in the phosphorylation of SR splicing factors and the regulation of splicing (PubMed:18559500, PubMed:21056976, PubMed:9472028). Promotes neuronal apoptosis by up-regulating cyclin-D1 (CCND1) expression (PubMed:19592491). This is done by the phosphorylation of SRSF2, leading to the suppression of p53/TP53 phosphorylation thereby relieving the repressive effect of p53/TP53 on cyclin-D1 (CCND1) expression (PubMed:21205200). Phosphorylates ACIN1, and redistributes it from the nuclear speckles to the nucleoplasm, resulting in cyclin A1 but not cyclin A2 up-regulation (PubMed:18559500). Plays an essential role in spliceosomal B complex formation via the phosphorylation of DDX23/PRP28 (PubMed:18425142). Probably by phosphorylating DDX23, leads to the suppression of incorrect R-loops formed during transcription; R-loops are composed of a DNA:RNA hybrid and the associated non-template single-stranded DNA (PubMed:28076779). Can mediate hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein phosphorylation (PubMed:12134018). Plays a negative role in the regulation of HBV replication through a mechanism not involving the phosphorylation of the core protein but by reducing the packaging efficiency of the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) without affecting the formation of the viral core particles (PubMed:16122776)	Cytoplasm
221	Q96SB4	Serine/arginine-rich protein-specific kinase which specifically phosphorylates its substrates at serine residues located in regions rich in arginine/serine dipeptides, known as RS domains and is involved in the phosphorylation of SR splicing factors and the regulation of splicing. Plays a central role in the regulatory network for splicing, controlling the intranuclear distribution of splicing factors in interphase cells and the reorganization of nuclear speckles during mitosis. Can influence additional steps of mRNA maturation, as well as other cellular activities, such as chromatin reorganization in somatic and sperm cells and cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 phosphorylates SFRS2, ZRSR2, LBR and PRM1. Isoform 2 phosphorylates SRSF1 using a directional (C-terminal to N-terminal) and a dual-track mechanism incorporating both processive phosphorylation (in which the kinase stays attached to the substrate after each round of phosphorylation) and distributive phosphorylation steps (in which the kinase and substrate dissociate after each phosphorylation event). The RS domain of SRSF1 binds first to a docking groove in the large lobe of the kinase domain of SRPK1. This induces certain structural changes in SRPK1 and/or RRM2 domain of SRSF1, allowing RRM2 to bind the kinase and initiate phosphorylation. The cycles continue for several phosphorylation steps in a processive manner (steps 1-8) until the last few phosphorylation steps (approximately steps 9-12). During that time, a mechanical stress induces the unfolding of the beta-4 motif in RRM2, which then docks at the docking groove of SRPK1. This also signals RRM2 to begin to dissociate, which facilitates SRSF1 dissociation after phosphorylation is completed. Isoform 2 can mediate hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein phosphorylation. It plays a negative role in the regulation of HBV replication through a mechanism not involving the phosphorylation of the core protein but by reducing the packaging efficiency of the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) without affecting the formation of the viral core particles. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 can induce splicing of exon 10 in MAPT/TAU. The ratio of isoform 1/isoform 2 plays a decisive role in determining cell fate in K-562 leukaemic cell line: isoform 2 favors proliferation where as isoform 1 favors differentiation	Cytoplasm
222	O43318	Serine/threonine kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway (PubMed:10094049, PubMed:11460167, PubMed:12589052, PubMed:16845370, PubMed:16893890, PubMed:21512573, PubMed:8663074, PubMed:9079627). Plays an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by changes in the environment (PubMed:10094049, PubMed:11460167, PubMed:12589052, PubMed:16845370, PubMed:16893890, PubMed:21512573, PubMed:8663074, PubMed:9079627). Mediates signal transduction of TRAF6, various cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1), transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB), TGFB-related factors like BMP2 and BMP4, toll-like receptors (TLR), tumor necrosis factor receptor CD40 and B-cell receptor (BCR) (PubMed:16893890, PubMed:9079627). Once activated, acts as an upstream activator of the MKK/JNK signal transduction cascade and the p38 MAPK signal transduction cascade through the phosphorylation and activation of several MAP kinase kinases like MAP2K1/MEK1, MAP2K3/MKK3, MAP2K6/MKK6 and MAP2K7/MKK7 (PubMed:11460167, PubMed:8663074). These MAP2Ks in turn activate p38 MAPKs and c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs); both p38 MAPK and JNK pathways control the transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1) (PubMed:11460167, PubMed:12589052, PubMed:8663074). Independently of MAP2Ks and p38 MAPKs, acts as a key activator of NF-kappa-B by promoting activation of the I-kappa-B-kinase (IKK) core complex (PubMed:12589052, PubMed:8663074). Mechanistically, recruited to polyubiquitin chains of RIPK2 and IKBKG/NEMO via TAB2/MAP3K7IP2 and TAB3/MAP3K7IP3, and catalyzes phosphorylation and activation of IKBKB/IKKB component of the IKK complex, leading to NF-kappa-B activation (PubMed:10094049, PubMed:11460167). In osmotic stress signaling, plays a major role in the activation of MAPK8/JNK1, but not that of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:16893890). Promotes TRIM5 capsid-specific restriction activity (PubMed:21512573). Phosphorylates RIPK1 at 'Ser-321' which positively regulates RIPK1 interaction with RIPK3 to promote necroptosis but negatively regulates RIPK1 kinase activity and its interaction with FADD to mediate apoptosis (By similarity).

Subsequently, the activated amino acid is transferred to the acceptor end of the cognate tRNA to form L-glutamyl-tRNA(Glu) and L-prolyl-tRNA(Pro) (PubMed:23263184, PubMed:24100331, PubMed:29576217, PubMed:3290852, PubMed:37212275). Upon interferon-gamma stimulation, EPRS1 undergoes phosphorylation, causing its dissociation from the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase multienzyme complex. It is recruited to form the GAIT complex, which binds to stem loop-containing GAIT elements found in the 3'-UTR of various inflammatory mRNAs, such as ceruloplasmin. The GAIT complex inhibits the translation of these mRNAs, allowing interferon-gamma to redirect the function of EPRS1 from protein synthesis to translation inhibition in specific cell contexts (PubMed:15479637, PubMed:23071094). Furthermore, it can function as a downstream effector in the mTORC1 signaling pathway, by promoting the translocation of SLC27A1 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane where it mediates the uptake of long-chain fatty acid by adipocytes. Thereby, EPRS1 also plays a role in fat metabolism and more indirectly influences lifespan (PubMed:28178239)	Cytoplasm, cytosol
272	Q01105	Multitasking protein, involved in apoptosis, transcription, nucleosome assembly and histone chaperoning. Isoform 2 anti-apoptotic activity is mediated by inhibition of the GZMA-activated DNase, NME1. In the course of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-induced apoptosis, GZMA cleaves SET, disrupting its binding to NME1 and releasing NME1 inhibition. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 are potent inhibitors of protein phosphatase 2A. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 inhibit EP300/CREBBP and PCAF-mediated acetylation of histones (HAT) and nucleosomes, most probably by masking the accessibility of lysines of histones to the acetylases. The predominant target for inhibition is histone H4. HAT inhibition leads to silencing of HAT-dependent transcription and prevents active demethylation of DNA. Both isoforms stimulate DNA replication of the adenovirus genome complexed with viral core proteins; however, isoform 2 specific activity is higher	Cytoplasm, cytosol

Unwinds preferentially partial DNA and RNA duplexes having a 17 bp annealed portion and either a hanging 3' tail or hanging tails at both 5'- and 3'-ends (PubMed:9889278). Plays an essential role in innate immunity by promoting CGAS and RIGI activity (PubMed:30510222, PubMed:30804210).

Partially redundant with PLD4, can cleave all four nucleotides displaying higher efficiency for ssDNA and RNA fragments initiated with uridine and guanosine residues and lower efficiency for cytidine-initiated substrates (PubMed:30111894, PubMed:30312375, PubMed:34620855, PubMed:37225734, PubMed:37994783, PubMed:38537643, PubMed:38697119). As a result, it does not always degrade polynucleotides to the single nucleotide level, it can stall at specific sites sparing certain fragments from exonucleolytic degradation (PubMed:30111894, PubMed:30312375, PubMed:34620855, PubMed:37225734, PubMed:37994783, PubMed:38537643, PubMed:38697119).

During the transport cycle alternates between 'inward-facing' state with peptide binding site facing the cytosol to 'outward-facing' state with peptide binding site facing the ER lumen. Peptide antigen binding to ATP-loaded TAP1-TAP2 induces a switch to hydrolysis-competent 'outward-facing' conformation ready for peptide loading onto nascent MHCI molecules. Subsequently ATP hydrolysis resets the transporter to the 'inward facing' state for a new cycle (PubMed:11274390, PubMed:25377891, PubMed:25656091). Typically transports intracellular peptide antigens of 8 to 13 amino acids that arise from cytosolic proteolysis via IFNG-induced immunoproteasome. Binds peptides with free N- and C-termini, the first three and the C-terminal residues being critical. Preferentially selects peptides having a highly hydrophobic residue at position 3 and hydrophobic or charged residues at the C-terminal anchor.

344	O15269	Component of the serine palmitoyltransferase multisubunit enzyme (SPT) that catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in sphingolipid biosynthesis by condensing L-serine and activated acyl-CoA (most commonly palmitoyl-CoA) to form long-chain bases. The SPT complex is also composed of SPTLC2 or SPTLC3 and SPTSSA or SPTSSB. Within this complex, the heterodimer with SPTLC2 or SPTLC3 forms the catalytic core (PubMed:19416851, PubMed:33558762, PubMed:36170811). The composition of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) complex determines the substrate preference (PubMed:19416851, PubMed:33558762). The SPTLC1-SPTLC2-SPTSSA complex shows a strong preference for C16-CoA substrate, while the SPTLC1-SPTLC3-SPTSSA isozyme uses both C14-CoA and C16-CoA as substrates, with a slight preference for C14-CoA (PubMed:19416851, PubMed:19648650). The SPTLC1-SPTLC2-SPTSSB complex shows a strong preference for C18-CoA substrate, while the SPTLC1-SPTLC3-SPTSSB isozyme displays an ability to use a broader range of acyl-CoAs, without apparent preference (PubMed:19416851, PubMed:19648650, PubMed:33558761, PubMed:33558762).

Component of a VCP/p97-AMFR/gp78 complex that participates in the final step of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) (PubMed:10456327, PubMed:11724934, PubMed:19103148, PubMed:24424410). The VCP/p97-AMFR/gp78 complex is involved in the sterol-accelerated ERAD degradation of HMGCR through binding to the HMGCR-INSIG1 complex at the ER membrane (PubMed:16168377, PubMed:22143767). In addition, interaction of AMFR with AUP1 facilitates interaction of AMFR with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2G2 and ubiquitin ligase RNF139, leading to sterol-induced HMGCR ubiquitination (PubMed:23223569). The ubiquitinated HMGCR is then released from the ER into the cytosol for subsequent destruction (PubMed:16168377, PubMed:22143767, PubMed:23223569). In addition to ubiquitination on lysine residues, catalyzes ubiquitination on cysteine residues: together with INSIG1, mediates polyubiquitination of SOAT2/ACAT2 at 'Cys-277', leading to its degradation when the lipid levels are low (PubMed:28604676). Catalyzes ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of INSIG1 when cells are depleted of sterols (PubMed:17043353). Mediates polyubiquitination of INSIG2 at 'Cys-215' in some tissues, leading to its degradation (PubMed:31953408). Also regulates ERAD through the ubiquitination of UBL4A a component of the BAG6/BAT3 complex (PubMed:21636303). Also acts as a scaffold protein to assemble a complex that couples ubiquitination, retranslocation and deglycosylation (PubMed:21636303). Mediates tumor invasion and metastasis as a receptor for the GPI/autocrine motility factor (PubMed:10456327). In association with LMBR1L and UBAC2, negatively regulates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in the lymphocytes by promoting the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of CTNNB1 and Wnt receptors FZD6 and LRP6 (PubMed:31073040).

Also involved in ITPR1 turnover in resting cells. Selectively inhibits the TLR3-triggered innate immune response by promoting the 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of TLR3 (PubMed:31076723)	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
352	Q9UM00	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium-selective channel preventing intracellular Ca2(+) stores from overfilling and maintaining calcium homeostasis in the ER (PubMed:27212239). In response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2(+) overloading, assembles into a homotetramer, forming a functional calcium-selective channel facilitating Ca2(+) release (PubMed:27212239). Mediates ER Ca2(+) homeostasis in osteoblasts and plays a key role in bone formation, via the CaMKII-HDAC4-RUNX2 signaling axis (By similarity). Component of the multi-pass translocon (MPT) complex that mediates insertion of multi-pass membrane proteins into the lipid bilayer of membranes (PubMed:32820719, PubMed:36261522). The MPT complex takes over after the SEC61 complex: following membrane insertion of the first few transmembrane segments of proteins by the SEC61 complex, the MPT complex occludes the lateral gate of the SEC61 complex to promote insertion of subsequent transmembrane regions (PubMed:36261522). Within the MPT complex, the GEL subcomplex may mediate insertion of transmembrane regions into the membrane (PubMed:36261522)	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
353	Q9P0L0	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored protein that mediates the formation of contact sites between the ER and endosomes via interaction with FFAT motif-containing proteins such as STARD3 or WDR44 (PubMed:32344433, PubMed:33124732). STARD3-VAPA interaction enables cholesterol transfer from the ER to endosomes (PubMed:33124732). Via interaction with WDR44 participates in neosynthesized protein export (PubMed:32344433). In addition, recruited to the plasma membrane through OSBPL3 binding (PubMed:25447204). The OSBPL3-VAPA complex stimulates RRAS signaling which in turn attenuates integrin beta-1 (ITGB1) activation at the cell surface (PubMed:25447204). With OSBPL3, may regulate ER morphology (PubMed:16143324). May play a role in vesicle trafficking (PubMed:11511104, PubMed:19289470)	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane

356	O15260	Endoplasmic reticulum cargo receptor that mediates the export of lipoproteins by recruiting cargos into COPII vesicles to facilitate their secretion (PubMed:29643117, PubMed:30251625, PubMed:33186557). Acts as a cargo receptor for lipoproteins bearing both APOB and APOA1, thereby regulating lipoprotein delivery and the maintenance of lipid homeostasis (PubMed:29643117, PubMed:33186557). Synergizes with the GTPase SAR1B to mediate transport of circulating lipoproteins (PubMed:33186557). Promotes the secretion of PCSK9 (PubMed:30251625). Also mediates the efficient secretion of erythropoietin (EPO) (PubMed:32989016).

357	Q9HD20	Endoplasmic reticulum translocase required to remove mitochondrial transmembrane proteins mistargeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:32973005, PubMed:36264797). Acts as a dislocase that mediates the ATP-dependent extraction of mislocalized mitochondrial transmembrane proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (PubMed:32973005).

358	Q9NRX5	Enhances the incorporation of serine into phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
359	Q86WV6	Facilitator of innate immune signaling that acts as a sensor of cytosolic DNA from bacteria and viruses and promotes the production of type I interferon (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta) (PubMed:18724357, PubMed:18818105, PubMed:19433799, PubMed:19776740, PubMed:23027953, PubMed:23747010, PubMed:23910378, PubMed:27801882, PubMed:29973723, PubMed:30842659, PubMed:35045565, PubMed:35388221, PubMed:36808561, PubMed:37832545, PubMed:25704810, PubMed:39255680). Innate immune response is triggered in response to non-CpG double-stranded DNA from viruses and bacteria delivered to the cytoplasm (PubMed:26300263). Acts by binding cyclic dinucleotides: recognizes and binds cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP), a second messenger produced by bacteria, cyclic UMP-AMP (2',3'-cUAMP), and cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), a messenger produced by CGAS in response to DNA virus in the cytosol (PubMed:21947006, PubMed:23258412, PubMed:23707065, PubMed:23722158, PubMed:23747010, PubMed:23910378, PubMed:26229117, PubMed:30842659, PubMed:35388221, PubMed:37379839). Upon binding to c-di-GMP, cUAMP or cGAMP, STING1 oligomerizes, translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum and is phosphorylated by TBK1 on the pLxIS motif, leading to recruitment and subsequent activation of the transcription factor IRF3 to induce expression of type I interferon and exert a potent anti-viral state (PubMed:22394562, PubMed:25636800, PubMed:29973723, PubMed:30842653, PubMed:35045565, PubMed:35388221). Exhibits 2',3' phosphodiester linkage-specific ligand recognition: can bind both 2'-3' linked cGAMP (2'-3'-cGAMP) and 3'-3' linked cGAMP but is preferentially activated by 2'-3' linked cGAMP (PubMed:23747010, PubMed:23910378, PubMed:26300263). The preference for 2'-3'-cGAMP, compared to other linkage isomers is probably due to the ligand itself, whichs adopts an organized free-ligand conformation that resembles the STING1-bound conformation and pays low energy costs in changing into the active conformation (PubMed:26150511). In addition to promote the production of type I interferons, plays a direct role in autophagy (PubMed:30568238, PubMed:30842662). Following cGAMP-binding, STING1 buds from the endoplasmic reticulum into COPII vesicles, which then form the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (PubMed:30842662). The ERGIC serves as the membrane source for WIPI2 recruitment and LC3 lipidation, leading to formation of autophagosomes that target cytosolic DNA or DNA viruses for degradation by the lysosome (PubMed:30842662). Promotes autophagy by acting as a proton channel that directs proton efflux from the Golgi to facilitate MAP1LC3B/LC3B lipidation (PubMed:37535724). The autophagy- and interferon-inducing activities can be uncoupled and autophagy induction is independent of TBK1 phosphorylation (PubMed:30568238, PubMed:30842662). Autophagy is also triggered upon infection by bacteria: following c-di-GMP-binding, which is produced by live Gram-positive bacteria, promotes reticulophagy (By similarity). May be involved in translocon function, the translocon possibly being able to influence the induction of type I interferons (PubMed:18724357). May be involved in transduction of apoptotic signals via its association with the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) (By similarity)	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
360	Q8N6M3	Fatty acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) diphosphatase that hydrolyzes fatty acyl-CoA to yield acyl-4'-phosphopantetheine and adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate (By similarity) (PubMed:32915949). Preferentially hydrolyzes unsaturated long-chain acyl-CoA substrates such as oleoyl-CoA/(9Z)-octadecenoyl-CoA and arachidonoyl-CoA/(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenoyl-CoA in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen (By similarity) (PubMed:32915949). This catalytic activity is required for maintaining ER structure and for lipid droplets (LDs) biogenesis, which are lipid storage organelles involved in maintaining lipid and energy homeostasis (By similarity) (PubMed:18160536, PubMed:32915949). Directly binds to diacylglycerol (DAGs) and triacylglycerol, which is also important for LD biogenesis (By similarity). May support directional budding of nacent LDs from the ER into the cytosol by reducing DAG levels at sites of LD formation (By similarity).

May mediate the interaction between VCP and misfolded glycoproteins (PubMed:16186509, PubMed:16449189). May also be involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced pre-emptive quality control, a mechanism that selectively attenuates the translocation of newly synthesized proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum and reroutes them to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation (PubMed:26565908)	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
362	Q5BJH7	Functions in endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport and regulates the proper organization of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi (By similarity).

363	Q9HCU5	Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that regulates the assembly of the coat protein complex II/COPII in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport. Selectively activates SAR1A and SAR1B by promoting the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) in these small GTPases (PubMed:32358066). In their activated GTP-bound state, SAR1A and SAR1B insert into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum where they recruit the remainder of the coat protein complex II/COPII which is responsible for both the sorting of proteins and the deformation and budding of membranes into vesicles destined to the Golgi (PubMed:32358066)	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane

366	Q96AA3	Intramembrane glycolipid transporter that operates in the biosynthetic pathway of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, the glycan precursors employed in protein asparagine (N)-glycosylation. The sequential addition of sugars to dolichol pyrophosphate produces dolichol-linked oligosaccharides containing fourteen sugars, including two GlcNAcs, nine mannoses and three glucoses. Once assembled, the oligosaccharide is transferred from the lipid to nascent proteins by oligosaccharyltransferases. The assembly of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides begins on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and finishes in its lumen. RFT1 could mediate the translocation of the cytosolically oriented intermediate DolPP-GlcNAc2Man5, produced by ALG11, into the ER lumen where dolichol-linked oligosaccharides assembly continues (PubMed:18313027, PubMed:19701946).

367	Q9NZ01	Involved in both the production of very long-chain fatty acids for sphingolipid synthesis and the degradation of the sphingosine moiety in sphingolipids through the sphingosine 1-phosphate metabolic pathway (PubMed:25049234). Catalyzes the last of the four reactions of the long-chain fatty acids elongation cycle (PubMed:12482854). This endoplasmic reticulum-bound enzymatic process, allows the addition of 2 carbons to the chain of long- and very long-chain fatty acids/VLCFAs per cycle (PubMed:12482854). This enzyme reduces the trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA fatty acid intermediate to an acyl-CoA that can be further elongated by entering a new cycle of elongation (PubMed:12482854). Thereby, it participates in the production of VLCFAs of different chain lengths that are involved in multiple biological processes as precursors of membrane lipids and lipid mediators (PubMed:12482854).

Catalyzes the first and rate limiting step in this pathway which is the desaturation of LA (18:2n-6) and ALA (18:3n-3) into gamma-linoleate (GLA) (18:3n-6) and stearidonate (18:4n-3), respectively (PubMed:12713571). Subsequently, in the biosynthetic pathway of HUFA n-3 series, it desaturates tetracosapentaenoate (24:5n-3) to tetracosahexaenoate (24:6n-3), which is then converted to docosahexaenoate (DHA)(22:6n-3), an important lipid for nervous system function (By similarity). Desaturates hexadecanate (palmitate) to produce 6Z-hexadecenoate (sapienate), a fatty acid unique to humans and major component of human sebum, that has been implicated in the development of acne and may have potent antibacterial activity (PubMed:12713571). It can also desaturate (11E)-octadecenoate (trans-vaccenoate, the predominant trans fatty acid in human milk) at carbon 6 generating (6Z,11E)-octadecadienoate (By similarity). In addition to Delta-6 activity, this enzyme exhibits Delta-8 activity with slight biases toward n-3 fatty acyl-CoA substrates (By similarity)	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
370	Q15629	Involved in the translocation of nascent protein chains into or through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by facilitating the proper chain positioning at the SEC61 channel (PubMed:12475939, PubMed:1315422, PubMed:32013668, PubMed:8616892, PubMed:9506517). Regulates the exposure of nascent secretory protein chain to the cytosol during translocation into the ER (PubMed:9506517). May affect the phospholipid bilayer in the vicinity of the lateral gate of the SEC61 channel, thereby facilitating ER protein transport (PubMed:32013668). Intimately associates with transmembrane (TM) domain of nascent membrane proteins during the entire integration process into the ER membrane (PubMed:8616892). Associates with the second TM domain of G-protein-coupled receptor opsin/OPSD nascent chain in the ER membrane, which may facilitate its integration into the membrane (PubMed:12475939). Under conditions of ER stress, participates in the disposal of misfolded ER membrane proteins during the unfolded protein response (UPR), an integrated stress response (ISR) pathway, by selectively retrotranslocating misfolded ER-membrane proteins from the ER into the cytosol where they are ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (PubMed:20430023)	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane

Within a catalytic cycle, acquires Ca(2+) or Mn(2+) ions on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and delivers them to the lumenal side. The transfer of ions across the membrane is coupled to ATP hydrolysis and is associated with a transient phosphorylation that shifts the pump conformation from inward-facing to outward-facing state (PubMed:16192278, PubMed:16332677, PubMed:30923126).

In turn, DNA damage and chromosomal instabilities increase and lead to cell proliferation and cancer development. The complex E6/E6AP targets several other substrates to degradation via the proteasome including host DLG1 or NFX1, a repressor of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). The resulting increased expression of hTERT prevents the shortening of telomere length leading to cell immortalization. Other cellular targets including BAK1, Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) and procaspase 8, are degraded by E6/E6AP causing inhibition of apoptosis. E6 also inhibits immune response by interacting with host IRF3 and TYK2.

Enhances host epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation after stimulation by EGF by inhibiting EGFR internalization. Induces a redistribution of host caveolin-1 and glycosphingolipid (ganglioside GM1) components of lipid rafts to the plasma membrane. Since GM1s inhibit cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, block immune synapse formation, and enhance proliferative signaling by the EGFR, E5 may enhance immune evasion and cell proliferation via a common mechanism. E5 also alters endosomal pH by interacting with the vacuolar H+-ATPase, which is a proton pump responsible for acidifying cellular organelles. Additionally, E5 prevents transport of the major histocompatibility class I to the cell surface and retains the complex in the Golgi apparatus.

442	P06789	ATP-dependent DNA 3'-5' helicase required for initiation of viral DNA replication. It forms a complex with the viral E2 protein. The E1-E2 complex binds to the replication origin which contains binding sites for both proteins. During the initial step, a dimer of E1 interacts with a dimer of protein E2 leading to a complex that binds the viral origin of replication with high specificity. Then, a second dimer of E1 displaces the E2 dimer in an ATP-dependent manner to form the E1 tetramer. Following this, two E1 monomers are added to each half of the site, which results in the formation of two E1 trimers on the viral ori. Subsequently, two hexamers will be created. The double hexamer acts as a bi-directional helicase machinery and unwinds the viral DNA and then recruits the host DNA polymerase to start replication	Host nucleus

EBNA1 binding to DS recruits the host origin recognition complex (ORC) (PubMed:12953058). Governs the faithful mitotic segregation of the viral episomes by binding both the FR (family of repeats) element within oriP and the host mitotic chromosomes (PubMed:11172042, PubMed:15479791, PubMed:24067969). Forms a cell cycle-dependent tyrosine-dependent DNA cross-link and single-strand cleavage at oriP required for terminating replication and maintaining viral episomes (PubMed:33482082). Counteracts the stabilization of host p53/TP53 by host USP7, thereby decreasing apoptosis and increasing host cell survival (PubMed:15808506). Induces degradation of host PML through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which promotes lytic reactivation and may impair the host cell DNA repair (PubMed:18833293). Increases the association of CK2 with PML proteins which increases the phosphorylation of PML proteins by CK2, triggering the polyubiquitylation and degradation of PML (PubMed:20719947). Displays inhibitory effects on a SUMO2-modified complex that includes STUB1, KAP1 and USP7 (PubMed:32176739).

Activates transcription by acting as an adapter molecule that binds to cellular sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins such as host CBF1, SMARCB1 and SPI1. Once EBNA2 is near promoter sites, its acidic activating domain recruits basal and activation-associated transcription factors TFIIB, TAF40, TFIIH components ERCC2 and ERCC3, and CBP in order to promote transcription. Alternatively, EBNA2 can affect activities of cell cycle regulators and retard cell cycle progression at G2/M phase.

Activated by amino acids through a mechanism involving the lysosomal V-ATPase, the Ragulator plays a dual role for the small GTPases Rag (RagA/RRAGA, RagB/RRAGB, RagC/RRAGC and/or RagD/RRAGD): it (1) acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), activating the small GTPases Rag and (2) mediates recruitment of Rag GTPases to the lysosome membrane (PubMed:22980980, PubMed:28935770, PubMed:29158492, PubMed:30181260, PubMed:31001086, PubMed:32686708, PubMed:36476874). Activated Ragulator and Rag GTPases function as a scaffold recruiting mTORC1 to lysosomes where it is in turn activated (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:22980980, PubMed:29158492). LAMTOR1 is directly responsible for anchoring the Ragulator complex to the lysosomal membrane (PubMed:31001086, PubMed:32686708). LAMTOR1 wraps around the other subunits of the Ragulator complex to hold them in place and interacts with the Rag GTPases, thereby playing a key role in the recruitment of the mTORC1 complex to lysosomes (PubMed:28935770, PubMed:29107538, PubMed:29123114, PubMed:29285400). Also involved in the control of embryonic stem cells differentiation via non-canonical RagC/RRAGC and RagD/RRAGD activation: together with FLCN, it is necessary to recruit and activate RagC/RRAGC and RagD/RRAGD at the lysosomes, and to induce exit of embryonic stem cells from pluripotency via non-canonical, mTOR-independent TFE3 inactivation (By similarity). Also required for late endosomes/lysosomes biogenesis it may regulate both the recycling of receptors through endosomes and the MAPK signaling pathway through recruitment of some of its components to late endosomes (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:22980980).

Involved in the uptake of single-stranded oligonucleotides by living cells, a process called gymnosis (PubMed:28277980). In vitro, mediates the uptake of linear DNA more efficiently than that of circular DNA, but exhibits similar uptake efficacy toward RNA and DNA.

499	P23219	Dual cyclooxygenase and peroxidase that plays an important role in the biosynthesis pathway of prostanoids, a class of C20 oxylipins mainly derived from arachidonate ((5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenoate, AA, C20:4(n-6)), with a particular role in the inflammatory response. The cyclooxygenase activity oxygenates AA to the hydroperoxy endoperoxide prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), and the peroxidase activity reduces PGG2 to the hydroxy endoperoxide prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor of all 2-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes. This complex transformation is initiated by abstraction of hydrogen at carbon 13 (with S-stereochemistry), followed by insertion of molecular O2 to form the endoperoxide bridge between carbon 9 and 11 that defines prostaglandins. The insertion of a second molecule of O2 (bis-oxygenase activity) yields a hydroperoxy group in PGG2 that is then reduced to PGH2 by two electrons (PubMed:7947975). Involved in the constitutive production of prostanoids in particular in the stomach and platelets. In gastric epithelial cells, it is a key step in the generation of prostaglandins, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which plays an important role in cytoprotection. In platelets, it is involved in the generation of thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which promotes platelet activation and aggregation, vasoconstriction and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (Probable).

Catalyzes the irreversible decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) via the thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) cofactor and subsequent transfer of the decarboxylated acyl intermediate on an oxidized dihydrolipoyl group that is covalently amidated to the E2 enzyme (dihydrolipoyllysine-residue succinyltransferase or DLST) (PubMed:24495017, PubMed:25210035, PubMed:28435050, PubMed:35272141). Plays a key role in the Krebs (citric acid) cycle, which is a common pathway for oxidation of fuel molecules, including carbohydrates, fatty acids, and amino acids (PubMed:25210035). Can catalyze the decarboxylation of 2-oxoadipate in vitro, but at a much lower rate than 2-oxoglutarate (PubMed:28435050). Mainly active in the mitochondrion (PubMed:29211711). A fraction of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex also localizes in the nucleus and is required for lysine succinylation of histones: associates with KAT2A on chromatin and provides succinyl-CoA to histone succinyltransferase KAT2A (PubMed:29211711)	Mitochondrion
501	O76031	ATP-dependent chaperone that functions as an unfoldase.

Thanks to its chaperone activity, it also functions in the incorporation of the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor into 5-aminolevulinate synthase, thereby activating 5-aminolevulinate (ALA) synthesis, the first step in heme biosynthesis (PubMed:28874591).

504	Q14318	Constitutively inactive PPiase, which becomes active when bound to calmodulin and calcium. Seems to act as a chaperone for BCL2, targets it to the mitochondria and modulates its phosphorylation state.

519	P12236	ADP:ATP antiporter that mediates import of ADP into the mitochondrial matrix for ATP synthesis, and export of ATP out to fuel the cell (By similarity). Cycles between the cytoplasmic-open state (c-state) and the matrix-open state (m-state): operates by the alternating access mechanism with a single substrate-binding site intermittently exposed to either the cytosolic (c-state) or matrix (m-state) side of the inner mitochondrial membrane (By similarity). In addition to its ADP:ATP antiporter activity, also involved in mitochondrial uncoupling and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) activity (PubMed:15033708). Plays a role in mitochondrial uncoupling by acting as a proton transporter: proton transport uncouples the proton flows via the electron transport chain and ATP synthase to reduce the efficiency of ATP production and cause mitochondrial thermogenesis (By similarity). Proton transporter activity is inhibited by ADP:ATP antiporter activity, suggesting that SLC25A6/ANT3 acts as a master regulator of mitochondrial energy output by maintaining a delicate balance between ATP production (ADP:ATP antiporter activity) and thermogenesis (proton transporter activity) (By similarity).

Within the 17S U2 SnRNP complex, SF3B1 is part of the SF3B subcomplex, which is required for 'A' complex assembly formed by the stable binding of U2 snRNP to the branchpoint sequence in pre-mRNA (PubMed:12234937). Sequence independent binding of SF3A and SF3B subcomplexes upstream of the branch site is essential, it may anchor U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA (PubMed:12234937). May also be involved in the assembly of the 'E' complex (PubMed:10882114). Also acts as a component of the minor spliceosome, which is involved in the splicing of U12-type introns in pre-mRNAs (PubMed:15146077, PubMed:33509932).

The 17S U2 SnRNP complex (1) directly participates in early spliceosome assembly and (2) mediates recognition of the intron branch site during pre-mRNA splicing by promoting the selection of the pre-mRNA branch-site adenosine, the nucleophile for the first step of splicing (PubMed:12234937, PubMed:32494006, PubMed:34822310).

This complex plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins, which could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Therefore, the proteasome participates in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or DNA damage repair. In the complex, PSMD11 is required for proteasome assembly.

581	Q9H668	Component of the CST complex proposed to act as a specialized replication factor promoting DNA replication under conditions of replication stress or natural replication barriers such as the telomere duplex. The CST complex binds single-stranded DNA with high affinity in a sequence-independent manner, while isolated subunits bind DNA with low affinity by themselves. Initially the CST complex has been proposed to protect telomeres from DNA degradation (PubMed:19854130). However, the CST complex has been shown to be involved in several aspects of telomere replication. The CST complex inhibits telomerase and is involved in telomere length homeostasis; it is proposed to bind to newly telomerase-synthesized 3' overhangs and to terminate telomerase action implicating the association with the ACD:POT1 complex thus interfering with its telomerase stimulation activity. The CST complex is also proposed to be involved in fill-in synthesis of the telomeric C-strand probably implicating recruitment and activation of DNA polymerase alpha (PubMed:22763445, PubMed:22964711). The CST complex facilitates recovery from many forms of exogenous DNA damage; seems to be involved in the re-initiation of DNA replication at repaired forks and/or dormant origins (PubMed:25483097). Required for efficicient replication of the duplex region of the telomere. Promotes efficient replication of lagging-strand telomeres (PubMed:22863775, PubMed:22964711). Promotes general replication start following replication-fork stalling implicating new origin firing (PubMed:22863775).

583	Q9Y3D0	Component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA) complex, a multiprotein complex that mediates the incorporation of iron-sulfur cluster into extramitochondrial Fe/S proteins (PubMed:22678361, PubMed:22678362, PubMed:23891004, PubMed:29848660). As a CIA complex component and in collaboration with CIAO1 and MMS19, binds to and facilitates the assembly of most cytosolic-nuclear Fe/S proteins (PubMed:23891004, PubMed:29848660). As part of the mitotic spindle-associated MMXD complex it plays a role in chromosome segregation, probably by facilitating iron-sulfur cluster assembly into ERCC2/XPD (PubMed:20797633). Together with MMS19, facilitates the transfer of Fe-S clusters to the motor protein KIF4A, which ensures proper localization of KIF4A to mitotic machinery components to promote the progression of mitosis (PubMed:29848660)	Nucleus
584	Q92878	Component of the MRN complex, which plays a central role in double-strand break (DSB) repair, DNA recombination, maintenance of telomere integrity and meiosis (PubMed:15064416, PubMed:21757780, PubMed:27889449, PubMed:28134932, PubMed:28867292, PubMed:9590181, PubMed:9651580, PubMed:9705271). The MRN complex is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) via homologous recombination (HR), an error-free mechanism which primarily occurs during S and G2 phases (PubMed:15064416, PubMed:21757780, PubMed:27889449, PubMed:28867292, PubMed:9590181, PubMed:9651580, PubMed:9705271). The complex (1) mediates the end resection of damaged DNA, which generates proper single-stranded DNA, a key initial steps in HR, and is (2) required for the recruitment of other repair factors and efficient activation of ATM and ATR upon DNA damage (PubMed:15064416, PubMed:27889449, PubMed:28867292, PubMed:9590181, PubMed:9651580, PubMed:9705271). The MRN complex possesses single-strand endonuclease activity and double-strand-specific 3'-5' exonuclease activity, which are provided by MRE11, to initiate end resection, which is required for single-strand invasion and recombination (PubMed:11741547, PubMed:9590181, PubMed:9651580, PubMed:9705271). Within the complex, RAD50 is both required to bind DNA ends and hold them in close proximity and regulate the activity of MRE11 (PubMed:11741547, PubMed:12805565, PubMed:28134932). RAD50 provides an ATP-dependent control of MRE11 by positioning DNA ends into the MRE11 active site: ATP-binding induces a large structural change from an open form with accessible MRE11 nuclease sites into a closed form (By similarity). The MRN complex is also required for DNA damage signaling via activation of the ATM and ATR kinases: the nuclease activity of MRE11 is not required to activate ATM and ATR (PubMed:15064416, PubMed:15790808, PubMed:16622404). The MRN complex is also required for the processing of R-loops (PubMed:31537797). In telomeres the MRN complex may modulate t-loop formation (PubMed:10888888)	Nucleus

Composed of multiple BRCT domains, which specifically recognize and bind phosphorylated proteins, bringing proteins together into functional combinations (PubMed:17575048, PubMed:20545769, PubMed:21777809, PubMed:26811421, PubMed:30898438, PubMed:31135337, PubMed:35597237, PubMed:37674080). Required for DNA replication initiation but not for the formation of pre-replicative complexes or the elongation stages (By similarity). Necessary for the loading of replication factors onto chromatin, including GMNC, CDC45, DNA polymerases and components of the GINS complex (By similarity).

Involved in double-strand break (DSB) repair via homologous recombination in S-phase by promoting the exchange between the DNA replication factor A (RPA) complex and RAD51 (PubMed:26811421, PubMed:35597237). Mechanistically, TOPBP1 is recruited to DNA damage sites in S-phase via interaction with phosphorylated HTATSF1, and promotes the loading of RAD51, thereby facilitating RAD51 nucleofilaments formation and RPA displacement, followed by homologous recombination (PubMed:35597237). Involved in microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) DNA repair by promoting recruitment of polymerase theta (POLQ) to DNA damage sites during mitosis (PubMed:37674080). MMEJ is an alternative non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) machinery that takes place during mitosis to repair DSBs in DNA that originate in S-phase (PubMed:37674080). Recognizes and binds POLQ phosphorylated by PLK1, enabling its recruitment to DSBs for subsequent repair (PubMed:37674080). Involved in G1 DNA damage checkpoint by acting as a molecular adapter that couples TP53BP1 and the 9-1-1 complex (PubMed:31135337). In response to DNA damage, triggers the recruitment of checkpoint signaling proteins on chromatin, which activate the CHEK1 signaling pathway and block S-phase progression (PubMed:16530042, PubMed:21777809). Acts as an activator of the kinase activity of ATR (PubMed:16530042, PubMed:21777809). Also required for chromosomal stability when DSBs occur during mitosis by forming filamentous assemblies that bridge MDC1 and tether broken chromosomes during mitosis (PubMed:30898438). Together with CIP2A, plays an essential role in the response to genome instability generated by the presence of acentric chromosome fragments derived from shattered chromosomes within micronuclei (PubMed:35121901, PubMed:35842428, PubMed:37165191, PubMed:37316668). Micronuclei, which are frequently found in cancer cells, consist of chromatin surrounded by their own nuclear membrane: following breakdown of the micronuclear envelope, a process associated with chromothripsis, the CIP2A-TOPBP1 complex tethers chromosome fragments during mitosis to ensure clustered segregation of the fragments to a single daughter cell nucleus, facilitating re-ligation with limited chromosome scattering and loss (PubMed:37165191, PubMed:37316668). Recruits the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex to E2F1-responsive promoters, thereby down-regulating E2F1 activity and inhibiting E2F1-dependent apoptosis during G1/S transition and after DNA damage (PubMed:12697828, PubMed:15075294)	Nucleus

Required for double-strand break repair and V(D)J recombination (PubMed:11493912, PubMed:12145306, PubMed:7957065, PubMed:8621488). Also has a role in chromosome translocation (PubMed:11493912, PubMed:12145306, PubMed:7957065, PubMed:8621488). The DNA helicase II complex binds preferentially to fork-like ends of double-stranded DNA in a cell cycle-dependent manner (PubMed:11493912, PubMed:12145306, PubMed:7957065, PubMed:8621488). It works in the 3'-5' direction (PubMed:11493912, PubMed:12145306, PubMed:7957065, PubMed:8621488). During NHEJ, the XRCC5-XRRC6 dimer performs the recognition step: it recognizes and binds to the broken ends of the DNA and protects them from further resection (PubMed:11493912, PubMed:12145306, PubMed:7957065, PubMed:8621488). Binding to DNA may be mediated by XRCC6 (PubMed:11493912, PubMed:12145306, PubMed:7957065, PubMed:8621488). The XRCC5-XRRC6 dimer acts as a regulatory subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase complex DNA-PK by increasing the affinity of the catalytic subunit PRKDC to DNA by 100-fold (PubMed:11493912, PubMed:12145306, PubMed:20383123, PubMed:7957065, PubMed:8621488). The XRCC5-XRRC6 dimer is probably involved in stabilizing broken DNA ends and bringing them together (PubMed:12145306, PubMed:20383123, PubMed:7957065, PubMed:8621488). The assembly of the DNA-PK complex to DNA ends is required for the NHEJ ligation step (PubMed:12145306, PubMed:20383123, PubMed:7957065, PubMed:8621488). The XRCC5-XRRC6 dimer probably also acts as a 5'-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyase (5'-dRP lyase), by catalyzing the beta-elimination of the 5' deoxyribose-5-phosphate at an abasic site near double-strand breaks (PubMed:20383123). XRCC5 probably acts as the catalytic subunit of 5'-dRP activity, and allows to 'clean' the termini of abasic sites, a class of nucleotide damage commonly associated with strand breaks, before such broken ends can be joined (PubMed:20383123). The XRCC5-XRRC6 dimer together with APEX1 acts as a negative regulator of transcription (PubMed:8621488).

Core effector of the ISR, which is required for adaptation to various stress such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, amino acid starvation, mitochondrial stress or oxidative stress (PubMed:31023583, PubMed:32132707). During ISR, ATF4 translation is induced via an alternative ribosome translation re-initiation mechanism in response to EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation, and stress-induced ATF4 acts as a master transcription factor of stress-responsive genes in order to promote cell recovery (PubMed:31023583, PubMed:32132706, PubMed:32132707). Promotes the transcription of genes linked to amino acid sufficiency and resistance to oxidative stress to protect cells against metabolic consequences of ER oxidation (By similarity).

Activates the transcription of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) in response to amino acid deprivation or ER stress (PubMed:11960987). However, when associated with DDIT3/CHOP, the transcriptional activation of the ASNS gene is inhibited in response to amino acid deprivation (PubMed:18940792). Together with DDIT3/CHOP, mediates programmed cell death by promoting the expression of genes involved in cellular amino acid metabolic processes, mRNA translation and the terminal unfolded protein response (terminal UPR), a cellular response that elicits programmed cell death when ER stress is prolonged and unresolved (By similarity). Activates the expression of COX7A2L/SCAF1 downstream of the EIF2AK3/PERK-mediated unfolded protein response, thereby promoting formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes and increasing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (PubMed:31023583).

The heterodimer gH/gL targets also host EPHA2 to promote viral entry	Virion membrane
722	P03177	Catalyzes the transfer of the gamma-phospho group of ATP to thymidine to generate dTMP in the salvage pathway of pyrimidine synthesis. The dTMP serves as a substrate for DNA polymerase during viral DNA replication. Allows the virus to be reactivated and to grow in non-proliferative cells lacking a high concentration of phosphorylated nucleic acid precursors	Virion tegument
723	Q76RH3	Plays an important role in the cytoplasmic envelopment of tegument proteins and capsids during the assembly and egress processes. Participates also in viral entry at the fusion step probably by regulating the core fusion machinery	Virion tegument
